Homework 3 

For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste)
your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all
the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

At the end, you will turn in this file along with your modified
dna_analysis.py program.


Problem 1:

The Total count variable and Seq length variable are always the same on all the test files. However, the sum count is different on all of them from total count and seq length. The Test Small file is the only file in which all of these three variables are the same. Im struggling to comprehend why there is this difference. Is it a problem found in the python code? Or is it a matter of understanding and visualizing DNA nucleotides that the missing numbers will be found? There is also a discrepancy with rounding (I believe in the Python code) where certain numbers are incredibly marginally slightly off..and I cannot figure out why.

Problem 2:

GC-content: 0.43029262963
AT-content: 0.568993851852
G nucleotides: 5738773
C nucleotides: 5879128
A nucleotides: 7701287
T nucleotides: 7661547
Sum count: 26980735
Total count: 27000000
seq length: 27000000
AT/GC Ratio: 1.32234161747
GC Classification: moderate GC content

Problem 3:


Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "dna_analysis.py", line 40, in <module>
    linenum = linenum + 1
NameError: name 'linenum' is not defined

* By commenting out that part of the code, it sets the variable lineup to being undefined so the code cannot run.

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "dna_analysis.py", line 66, in <module>
    gc_count = gc_count + 1
NameError: name 'gc_count' is not defined

* By commenting out this part of the code, it sets the variable gc_count to being undefined so the code cannot run. 


Problem 4:

GC-content: 0.43029262963
AT-content: 0.568993851852

Reflection:

... At first this assignment seemed very daunting because of the complex and novel nature of the code for DNA sequencing. Or maybe the concept of being intimate with code for sequencing DNA (even if simply) was a mental hurdle to get over. It turned out to be much easier and was more about augmenting or editing pre=existing code than creating new code.
