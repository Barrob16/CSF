Homework 3 

For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste)
your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all
the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

At the end, you will turn in this file along with your modified
dna_analysis.py program.


Problem 1:



Problem 2:

GC-content: 0.43029262963

Problem 3:


Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "dna_analysis.py", line 40, in <module>
    linenum = linenum + 1
NameError: name 'linenum' is not defined

* By commenting out that part of the code, it sets the variable lineup to being undefined so the code cannot run.

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "dna_analysis.py", line 66, in <module>
    gc_count = gc_count + 1
NameError: name 'gc_count' is not defined

* By commenting out this part of the code, it sets the variable gc_count to being undefined so the code cannot run. 


Problem 4:

GC-content: 0.43029262963
AT-content: 0.568993851852

Collaboration:

... Did by myself

Reflection:

... At first this assignment seemed very daunting because of the complex and novel nature of the code for DNA sequencing. Or maybe the concept of being intimate with code for sequencing DNA (even if simply) was a mental hurdle to get over. It turned out to be much easier and was more about augmenting or editing pre=existing code than creating new code.
