### Problem 1

# DO NOT CHANGE THE FOLLOWING LINE
print "Problem 1 solution follows:"

import hw2_test
from hw2_test import n

while (n < 5050) :
    n - 100
    n + 1

print 'Sum of all the natural numbers from 1 to n:' , n
        
# Am not sure by what you mean with 'add numbers manually'?- This code has
# N = 100, then sets n to 0 by 'N - 100'. Then it adds 1 to 0 or N untill it reaches 5050.
# Which I know to be the sum of all natural numbers 1 to 100 (N)
