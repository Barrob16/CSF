What am I trying to do with this project?:
* From a internet source.. Twitter/Facebook/Newspaper articles..etc. gather text. I.E. the last 10 
* Tweets from various sources. Take those tweets and convert them into text. Take that text and either use a markov chain to
* combine them and create pseudo-random text/poetry clippings. 
* Or use an allgorithm to see what words are said the most, or what is trending in the small sample size of tweets being drawn from. 

What I need for project:

* Web Scraping program/code. Specifically for twitter?
* Markov Generator program/code to take text and randomize it into abstrast poetry/text?
* Weighted algorithm for words that appear the most?

Questions:
* Both these exsist. Create own? Take and edit exsisting code?
* Manually fetch or automatically fetch and run?
